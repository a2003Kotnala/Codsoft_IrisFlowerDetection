***Iris Flower Detection ðŸŒ¸***

This project is an Iris flower detection system developed using machine learning and data analysis techniques. It aims to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their features, which is a common introductory task in the field of data science and machine learning. ðŸŒ¼

***Overview ðŸ“‹***

In this project, we utilize machine learning and data analysis to build a classifier for Iris flowers. The Iris dataset contains information about various Iris species, including features such as:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The project includes the following key components:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones.
4. Machine Learning Model: Building and training a predictive model for Iris flower classification.
5. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using relevant metrics.
